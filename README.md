# CPU-Simulation
Using Object Oriented code to simulate the CPU and all its different parts such as the PC, Registers, Memory, and more.

To use this and see how it works please open and compile the TestComputer file to start. Dont forget to also use program(1).ex and program.asm.txt so the simulation knows what kind of instructions to convert. Please input any two numbers and this basic simulation of a CPU will use basic machine instruction to output the largest of the two numbers
